# *Dog Breed Classifier* - Convolutional Neural Network

This project is an extension of a project originaly developed as a part of [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

*Submitted: Aug 2019*

## Objective
The purpose of the part of the project created by Udacity is to create a neural network that is capable of distinguishing dog breeds from a image. This is later extended, by creating an app, where a user can upload a image of dog and get a prediction.

### Methods Used
* Convolutional Neural Network (**CNN**)
* Trasnfer Learning

### Technologies
* Python
* PyTorch
* Flask, Flask-Restful
