I choose to start with similar preprocessing that I used while writing function *VGG16_predict* by resizing picture to 256 pixels on the shorter side and cropping out 224x224 pixels from the center of the image. I added two transformations to increase the models accuracy, random rotation and random horizontal flip. After transforming image to a tensor, the values must be normalized with mean and standard deviation for each color channel. I tried different approaches to do so. First was using the same values, that are required for pretrained networks trained on ImageNet dataset. Second was calculating the mean and std of the training dataset in this project. With both of these methods I was not able to achieve accuracy above 10%. The final approach was to normalize values with *mean = 0.5* and *std = 0.5* for all color channels, which transforms values to be within the range \\[-1,1\\]."

    "The model seems to be doing decent job in identifying dog breeds. I was able to recognize all three Mastiffs correctly and later other tested breeds, that were part of the training set. Finding resemblance between humans and dog breeds is a little bit difficult to evaluate, but I would say I can see similar features in some cases.<br>\n",
    "Some steps to improve this app could be:<br>\n",
    "- 1. Add more dog breeds to the training dataset and retrain the model. Since there are more than 300 breeds recognized by [FCI](http://www.fci.be/en/) and this dataset has only 133 classes some well-known dog breeds can't be identified.<br>\n",
    "- 2. Possible improvement of face detection could be done by using different [pretrained detectors](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).<br>\n",
    "- 3. Tuning of the model is another possibility. Different changes like adjusting the learning rate, increasing | decreasing the number of hidden layers, trying different optimizer or choosing different dropout can all improve the model performance.<br>\n",
    "- 4. Testing different pretrained architecture instead of VGG16.\n",
    "- 5. Adding more options for data augmentation. For example randomly converting images to black and gray could possibly help recognizing breeds, that have multiple color versions."
